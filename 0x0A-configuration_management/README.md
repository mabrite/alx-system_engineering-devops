Introduction
Configuration management is essential for managing the complexity of software systems, ensuring consistency across different environments, and facilitating efficient collaboration among development and operations teams. This project focuses on the practical aspects of configuration management, covering popular tools and best practices.

Tools
The project explores the following configuration management tools:

Ansible: An open-source automation tool that simplifies configuration management and application deployment.

Puppet: A configuration management tool that automates the provisioning and management of infrastructure.

Chef: A powerful automation platform that manages infrastructure as code.

Docker: A containerization platform that facilitates the packaging and distribution of software applications.

Project Structure
The project is organized into directories for each configuration management tool. Each directory contains examples, scripts, and documentation specific to that tool. The structure is as follows:
